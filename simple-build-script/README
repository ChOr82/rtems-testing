This directory contains the build_tools script.  This script is used to
build and install an RTEMS toolset from source.  You are responsible for
downloading the various tools from either release images or their
development versions and patching as appropriate.

To build the tools, simply invoke the following command with INSTALL_POINT
replaced with "prefix" in GNU tool terms:

./build_tools INSTALL_POINT

Depending on the target and the speed of the machine, this can take
anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours.

When completed, you should prepend INSTALL_POINT/bin to your PATH:

export PATH=INSTALL_POINT/bin:$PATH

Since you need the proper autoconf and automake versions to bootstrap
RTEMS from CVS, these are included in the build script.
