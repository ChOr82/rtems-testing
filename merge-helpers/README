This directory contains helpers for dealing with the RTEMS CVS Repository
during maintenance activities.

commit-with-changelog-diff
  This utility is used when a patch is submitted with a diff that includes
  the ChangeLog entry prepended to the ChangeLog.  This diffs the ChangeLog
  and extracts the added Log entry.  Then it commits all files from the
  current directory using that ChangeLog entry. 
cvscommit
  This utility takes a message on the command line and uses mkChangeLogList
  to properly format it.  It then allows you the option to edit it and
  commit files from the current directory using that Log entry.
mkChangeLogList
  This utility formats a ChangeLog entry using a message from the
  command line.  It uses the user information from /etc/passwd by 
  default but can be told to use another user's information or
  an explicit name and email address.
prepend
  This is used to prepend a file to the ChangeLog.
