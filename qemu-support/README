This directory contains files which assist in using qemu with RTEMS.

pc386_fda.bz2 - uncompress and place in ~/qemu.  This file boots test.exe
                from the hd which is ~/qemu/hd in the scripts.

NOTE: Joel has two other things to add from other machines.

pc386_fda_slow - pauses before booting test.exe so you can attach gdb. 

qemu-nic - run with network support configured
