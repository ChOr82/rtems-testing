This directory contains files which assist in using qemu with RTEMS.

pc386_fda.bz2 - uncompress and place in ~/qemu.  This file boots test.exe
                from the hd which is ~/qemu/hd in the scripts.

pc386_fda_slow - pauses before booting test.exe so you can attach gdb. 

qemu-nic - run with network support configured.  EDIT THIS AS NEEDED

qemu-ifup - Needs to be in /etc

qemu-ifdown - Needs to be in /etc

Networking Instructions
=======================

To run networking programs on qemu, you have to do some system setup.

cp qemu-ifup qemu-ifdown /etc

After each reboot, you will need to load the tap/tunneling interface.

/sbin/modprobe tun

You have to run the network programs as root (yes it sucks).  The script
qemu-nic can do this.  Edit it as needed.  If you use COM1 as console,
the script may need editing for that.

As you:
  cd network-demos
  cp networkconfig-qemu.h networkconfig.h
  RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH=${INSTALLPATH}/i386-rtems4.10/pc386 make clean all
  cp TESTNAME/o-optimize/*.exe ~/qemu/hd/test.exe

This should compile the network demos to use qemu with the Intel 
EtherExpress Pro NIC driver in the RTEMS tree.  And it copies one
of them into the directory we autoboot test.exe from.

As root:
  qemu-nic

This should bring up qemu and put the NIC interface on 10.0.2.5.
