	app_common.h, coverage_converter.cc, do_coverage:  Extensive re-write
	to perform analysis based on a list of symbols instead of an address
	range.  This allows executables that are linked differently to be
	analyzed together.  Note that this update has broken covmerge and

	covmerge.cc, do_coverage: Re-worked the design a bit to eliminate the
	need for a trace conversion step.  Instead the coverage reader for
	QEMU will just read the trace into a coverage map.  Also changed the
	trace converter into a coverage converter.  It will allow conversion
	between different coverage file formats.
	* CoverageReaderQEMU.cc, CoverageReaderQEMU.h,
	coverage_converter.cc: New files.
	* TraceFactory.cc, TraceFactory.h, TraceReaderBase.cc,
