mutexinit.c:165
Simple Test Case
This code is not initializing a specific type of mutex -- probably recursive.
+++

pthread.c:125
Simple Test Case
This is a case of attempting to change the priority of a thread
whose priority is above that of the "high" priority it is supposed
to have.  This is just a matter of having a thread at a high priority
when its budget runs out.
+++

pthread.c:126
Simple Test Case
This is 1/2 of pthread.c:125.
+++

coremutex.inl:171
Simple Test Case
pri ceiling, acquire when pri = ceiling
+++

coremutexsurrender.c:188
Simple Test Case
There must not be a test of a priority ceiling mutex getting released
which results in a thread being unblocked and the UNBLOCKED thread's
priority being elevated.
+++

threadinitialize.c:100
Simple Test Case
This is for the case where the application uses the POSIX
thread stack address attribute.

NOTE: Code Should be Configured on POSIX
+++

pipe.c:28
Simple Test Case
Pass in a NULL file descriptor.
+++

pipe/pipe.c:35
Simple Test Case
This looks like ar error on the path passed in to create.
+++

pipe/pipe.c:82
Simple Test Case
This looks like a common error path which will be covered if you
generate the other errors.

+++

pipe/pipe.c:50
Simple Test Case
This looks like you need to create multiple pipes so the name generation
algorithm has a conflict on its first N attempts.
+++

pipe/pipe.c:65
Simple Test Case
This looks like there is no test code for blocking mode.
+++

pipe/pipe.c:72
Simple Test Case
This looks like a special test where you can create/open the first
pipe file descriptor but not the second.
+++

bspcmdline_getparam.c:65
Simple Test Case
Need a test case to return NULL.
+++

bspcmdline_getparamrhs.c:41
Simple Test Case
Need a test case to return NULL.
+++

fifo.c:170
Simple Test Case
This looks like an existing test is broken or is only testing error paths.
