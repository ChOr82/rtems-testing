privateenv.c:43
Simple Test Case
free_user_env is never called when (env == &rtems_global_user_env).  It is
possible that this path is impossible but that will require analysis of the
callers.  Since this is static, it is quite possible this is covered by
the callers.

Not root and not owner.  Please try to cover all branch paths.

imfs_fifo.c:61
Requires Discussion
This is an error return path which only returns an error when
pipe_release() returns an error but pipe_release() can't return
an error.  Maybe pipe_release() should be changed to void.

imfs_getchild.c:51
Simple Test Case
Appprently we never call this with ".." for the parent directory.

imfs_fsunmount.c:86
Ask Chris Johns
I think he wrote this code and can probably identify the test case.

+++

imfs_initsupp.c:55
Requires Discussion
I think this is an error case that cannot be reached.  The
bytes_per_block is set by confdefs.h and there are error checks
in that to prevent a bad value.
+++

imfs_mount.c:44
Unreachable?
We need to ask Chris Johns about this. I believe this is a
case where the error checking has been done by the system 
call layer.  I analyzed the "file handlers" callbacks for
guarantees on parameters.  This indicates the same analysis
needs to happen for "file system handlers."

imfs_debug.c:43
Simple Test Case
Need to do an IMFS_dump after loading a tarfile from memory.
I think this is a simple addition to tar01.
+++

imfs_debug.c:54
Simple Test Case
Need to do an IMFS_dump on an IMFS filesystem which has a very large
file in it.  I think this is a simple addition to one of the existing
IMFS tests which creates a large file.
+++

imfs_debug.c:88
Simple Test Case
We need to do an IMFS_dump on an IMFS filesystem which has a bad node type
in it.  This may require peeking behind the curtain and changing a value.

I think this is either a simple test or unreachable code.  We need

dup2.c:51
Simple Test Case
This looks like we never get to the bottom to actually call fcntl()
which I take to mean that we do not have a test for a working call 
to dup2().

But we need to be careful because fcntl(F_DUPFD) which is called has
slightly different semantics.  I suspect that fcntl(F_DUPFD) is wrong.
See fcntl.c:55 for more details.
+++

fcntl.c:55
Discuss
I question that this is correct.  We are calling this from dup2()
and the semantics are slightly different.  fcntl is 
I suspect that by adding a shared routine and calling it from fcntl()
and and dup2() we can fix this.
+++

fcntl.c:83
Simple Test Case
We need a test setting close on exec.

fcntl.c:143
Simple Test Case
None of the file system specific handlers have ever returned an error here.

newlibc_exit.c:89
Simple Test Case
libc_wrapup() is never called when the system state is down.
+++

readv.c:106
Simple Test Case
The count needs to be -1 in one of the requests.  Also add a test for
0 value at the same time since it appears that is a missing branch
condition.
+++

getpwent.c:127
Discuss
I think this is detecting whether or not the read can be fulfilled
from the buffer.  But I am not sure.
+++

getpwent.c:141
Simple Test Case
I think this is a matter of putting in a VERY large number in
a numeric field.  This is detecting overflow.  I think a long
string of 9's will do most of this.
+++

getpwent.c:142
Simple Test Case

See getpwent.c:141
+++

getpwent.c:112
Simple Test Case

This is actually the error case at line 103 (*nleft < 2).  I think this
will be hit by having a password entry which does not have enough
characters left in the user's return buffer while something is
being copied into it.

writev.c:104

vprintk.c:125
Simple Test Case
0x6f is a 'o'.  It looks like we do not have a printk test which uses %o.

imfs_load_tar.c:112
Simple Test Case
Need to make sure one of the tar tests is configured with the IMFS
and the other is configured with fifoIMFS.
+++

imfs_load_tar.c:151
Simple Test Case
We apparently only have a relative symbolic link.  We need to include
one which has an absolute path. This will be a broken symlink on the
host but resolve fine on the target.

imfs_load_tar.c:169
Medium Test Case
The eval for make must fail.  We will have to ask Jennifer how to
make this call fail.
