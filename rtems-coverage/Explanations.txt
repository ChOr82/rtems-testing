mutexinit.c:165
Simple Test Case
This code is not initializing a specific type of mutex -- probably recursive.
+++

pthread.c:125
Simple Test Case
This is a case of attempting to change the priority of a thread
whose priority is above that of the "high" priority it is supposed
to have.  This is just a matter of having a thread at a high priority
when its budget runs out.
+++

pthread.c:126
Simple Test Case
This is 1/2 of pthread.c:125.
+++

coremutex.inl:171
Simple Test Case
pri ceiling, acquire when pri = ceiling
+++

coremutexsurrender.c:188
Simple Test Case
There must not be a test of a priority ceiling mutex getting released
which results in a thread being unblocked and the UNBLOCKED thread's
priority being elevated.
+++

threadinitialize.c:100
Simple Test Case
This is for the case where the application uses the POSIX
thread stack address attribute.

NOTE: Code Should be Configured on POSIX
