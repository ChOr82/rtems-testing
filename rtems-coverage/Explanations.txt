pthread.c:1149
Simple Test Case
This is a case of attempting to change the priority of a thread
whose priority is above that of the "high" priority it is supposed
to have.  This is just a matter of having a thread at a high priority
when its budget runs out.

There is another case of a branch not taken which is actually
when the thread is holding a resource and we do not want to bump
its priority.

So there are actually two cases which could branch here.
