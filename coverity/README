STATUS
======
+ This script has a number of hard-coded variables that should probably
  be passed in on the command line.

+ There are likely errors it does not detect.  So far, it looks like
  a lot can go wrong. :)

+ I do not know how to grab the information on a Coverity issue and
  bring it to the community in a way that is nice yet.  I don't care
  whether this is automated or not because we don't have many issues.
  But when we file PRs on Coverity issues, people need to see the report.
