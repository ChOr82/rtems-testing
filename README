This package contains a collection of scripts and support files
that support running the GCC (http://gcc.gnu.org) testsuite for
C, C++, Ada.

This testing environment is used on the GCC Compile Farm as well
as at OAR.

Source Code and Patches
=======================
You are responsible for setting up the source. And it should look
something like this:

TESTROOT
  - gcc-SOURCE
  - gdb-SOURCE
  - rtems-SOURCE
  - automake-SOURCE
  - autoconf-SOURCE
  - binutils-SOURCE
  - gcc-testing (this package)

Update gcc-testing/VERSIONS to point to the appropriate directories
and versions.

rtems-SOURCE is assumed to be a CVS checkout by test_driver.
gcc-SOURCE is assumed to be an SVN checkout by test_driver.

Look near the top of do_one for a number of environment variables
such as whether to build binutils and gdb from source or just
copy the RPM contents to the working install point.

do_one in this directory has a LOT of options to control what to do.

DejaGNU Support Files
=====================

${HOME}/.dejagnurc may point dejagnu to another location.

      set boards_dir /home/joel/dejagnu/boards

The scripts in this directory use their own dejagnu/boards support.

Ada ACATS Testing Support Files
===============================

The files in gcc/testsuite/ada/acats/ directory support 
that directory in the gcc source tree.

C/C++ Support Files
======================

The files rtems_gcc_main.c and rundeja in the top directory
support the gcc/testsuite subdirectory in the gcc source tree.
